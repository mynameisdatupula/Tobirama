				Tobirama Senju (千手扉間, Senju Tobirama) was the Second Hokage (二代目火影, Nidaime Hokage; Literally meaning "Second Fire Shadow") of Konohagakure. He hails from the Senju clan, who, along with the Uchiha clan, founded the first shinobi village. Tobirama would also become the leader of his own team. Prior to inheriting the position of Hokage, he served as his brother's advisor, assisting him with political and social measures.

				Tobirama was born into the Senju clan to its then-leader Butsuma. Tobirama along with his elder brother Hashirama and their younger brothers Kawarama, and Itama all grew up in the Warring States Period where they were surrounded by constant battles. One of these battles would lead to the early death of Kawarama, and several other of his clansmen, whose funeral he attended alongside his father and siblings. Hashirama later ended up in an altercation with his father over the senseless killing of innocent children. This led to his father almost striking him again, but Tobirama intervened advocating that Hashirama was grief-stricken. Later, as the three siblings met up, they spoke of peace for the future and Tobirama stated his opinion about ending the conflict by giving the shinobi a code of conduct to stop the endless killing. He later admonished Itama for his way of thinking — which sounded a great deal like the way the adults thought. Some time later, Itama was killed on the battlefield.
