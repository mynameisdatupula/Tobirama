				Skills
				<p><b>(千手扉間, Senju Tobirama)</b></p>
			</h2>

			
			</br>

			<p>
				Tobirama was hailed as one of the most powerful shinobi of his era and one of the most gifted shinobi in history. Since childhood, Tobirama was noted to be a skilled shinobi even by the likes of Madara Uchiha. Madara has openly acknowledged that in life their power was comparable to each other, further attesting to Tobirama's legendary prowess. A testament to his prowess was such that he was able to fight on equal ground and ultimately kill Izuna Uchiha — who was noted to be as strong as his brother Madara. Danzō also stated that during his reign as Hokage, there was no shinobi who could match his prowess. During his reign, he battled and survived against the Gold and Silver Brothers who were imbued with the Nine-Tails chakra and wielded the Treasured Tools of the Sage of the Six Paths.

			<h3>
				<b> Sensory Perception</b>
			</h3>

			<p>
				Tobirama was also a very gifted sensor ninja since childhood. By simply touching the ground with his finger, he could detect the presence and number of enemy shinobi. He was even able to detect Madara Uchiha's chakra on a battlefield far away, despite being in a different country. His sensory skills were so refined and accurate that he could distinguish between different chakra signatures by clan, as upon sensing Karin, he determined she was an Uzumaki. He was also able to notice how Orochimaru's new body was made almost entirely of Hashirama's cells. He could use his abilities, along with his tracking skills, in order to follow a target undetected. He can likewise still sense the chakra of others, even when his ability to mould chakra is impaired.

			<h3>
				<b> Space-Time Ninjutsu</b>
			</h3>
			
			<img src="images/teleport.png" width = "200px" height="150px" style="float:left ; margin-right: 15px"/>
			<p>
				Tobirama was also very skilled in the use of Space–Time Ninjutsu, so much so that Minato Namikaze was shocked when he realised that Tobi was more adept in this skill than Tobirama and himself. As its creator, he was able to use the Flying Thunder God Technique, a technique that creates a unique seal to mark places or targets he wished to teleport to. Tobirama is also able to link himself to the seals created by another user of this technique. Likewise he is capable of teleporting multiple people with or without accompanying them or even being in direct contact with them. Tobirama can also teleport massive objects such as jinchūriki in Tailed Beast Mode.

			<h3>
				<b> Ninjutsu</b>
			</h3>

			<p>
				In areas with water, he could move and stay underwater for a considerable amount of time without detrimental effects. In addition, he could use tendrils of water to grab hold of his target or pull it underwater in order to drown it. With the Water Release: Water Formation Wall, he could produce a powerful barrier of water able to easily disperse very intense fire blasts. He could launch large pressurised missiles of water which were capable of destroying a chakra-infused earthen wall. He can also use the Water Release: Water Severing Wave technique which creates a high-pressure stream, capable of cutting through the branches of the Ten-Tails' tree form with ease. In the anime, it is also shown that he could use the Water Release: Water Colliding Wave to attack and cover a large area with water. He was also shown that he could single-handedly counter the Uchiha clan's signature technique from one of its most gifted members, a feat that usually requires several Water Release users working together.

			<h3>
				<b> Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation</b>
			</h3>
			<br>
			
			<p>
				
			In his time, Tobirama was famous for his use Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation and is one of three people capable of performing it. Those of his generation immediately thought it was his doing following their reincarnation. Though as of yet, Tobirama's use has been unseen, several shinobi have made allusions to his use. Tobirama's usage of the latter involved him using the reincarnated to wipe a map clean using large-scale ninjutsu. His control over the technique is less refined, however, and it was implied by Chiyo that he could not control a large quantity at a single given time. Along with this technique, he created a fighting style to accompany it, which could be described as kamikaze in nature, where due to the immortal body of the reincarnated person, techniques that generally could not be used either at close-range or at all become possible. One such technique is the Flying Thunder God Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags, which creates a near-infinite chain of explosions on a target. Some time after its creation, he labelled it as a kinjutsu.

			<!--<p>
				Tobirama was born into the Senju clan to its then-leader Butsuma. Tobirama along with his elder brother Hashirama and their younger brothers Kawarama, and Itama all grew up in the Warring States Period where they were surrounded by constant battles. One of these battles would lead to the early death of Kawarama, and several other of his clansmen, whose funeral he attended alongside his father and siblings. Hashirama later ended up in an altercation with his father over the senseless killing of innocent children. This led to his father almost striking him again, but Tobirama intervened advocating that Hashirama was grief-stricken. Later, as the three siblings met up, they spoke of peace for the future and Tobirama stated his opinion about ending the conflict by giving the shinobi a code of conduct to stop the endless killing. He later admonished Itama for his way of thinking — which sounded a great deal like the way the adults thought. Some time later, Itama was killed on the battlefield.
